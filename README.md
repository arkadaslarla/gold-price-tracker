# Gold-Price-Tracker
This is a simple web app that tracks the current price of gold in different currencies. It uses the Metal Price API to fetch the latest gold prices and displays them on the page.
# How it works
The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the fetch() method to make a request to the Metal Price API and parse the JSON response. The app then displays the gold prices on the page using DOM manipulation.
# How to use it
To use the app, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You can also modify the app to track gold prices in different currencies by changing the currencies variable in the JavaScript file.
